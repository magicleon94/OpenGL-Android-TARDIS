# OpenGL-Android-TARDIS
A work in progress Arduino-controlled TARDIS with OpenGL.
The idea is to have a TARDIS (from the Dr. Who TV show) model, which is currently untextured, spinning like the original, 
and moving in a 3d space accordingly to the accelerometer/gyroscope values of an Android phone.
