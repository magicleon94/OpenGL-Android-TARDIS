# OpenGL-Arduino-TARDIS
A work in progress Arduino-controlled TARDIS with OpenGL

I've just pushed the repo do github, some snippets found online will be credited soon.

The idea is to have a TARDIS (from Dr. Who) model, which is currently untextured, spinning like the original, 
and moving in a 3d space accordingly to an external accelerometer/gyroscope hooked to an Arduino.
